ETHEREUM,"Here's a professional, urgent-style news article based on your content: 🚨 BREAKING: Israeli President Urges Global Action to Dismantle Iran’s Nuclear Program 🚨 📅 June 19, 2025 In a powerful and urgent address, Israeli President Isaac Herzog has issued a global call to action, urging the entire international community to unite in confronting Iran’s advancing nuclear program. Labeling it a “threat to world peace and regional stability,” Herzog emphasized that “Israel cannot act alone.” 🗣️ “The international community must rise and prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons capabilities before it’s too late,” Herzog declared, raising alarms amid growing concerns that Tehran is edging closer to weapons-grade enrichment. ⚠️ This statement comes at a time of increasing geopolitical tension in the Middle East, with intelligence sources and defense analysts warning that Iran may be nearing a nuclear threshold. Herzog’s message signals a dramatic escalation in Israel’s rhetoric, suggesting that time for diplomacy may be running out. 🔍 The global community is now at a crossroads: Will world powers intervene diplomatically or militarily? Can unified international pressure succeed where negotiations have stalled? 💣 The stakes are higher than ever. Failure to act, Herzog warns, could lead to irreversible consequences. 💬 What’s your view?

XRP,"In a significant development for the crypto market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally initiated the review process for Franklin Templeton’s proposed $XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This move marks a pivotal moment as the regulatory body begins to seriously consider the approval of crypto-backed ETFs beyond Bitcoin $BTC and Ethereum $ETH . What Does This Mean for XRP? The official review process is the first necessary step before any ETF can be approved and launched in the U.S. market. Franklin Templeton’s filing aims to create a spot XRP ETF, which would directly hold XRP tokens — allowing institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to XRP without the need to purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. If approved, this XRP ETF could bring: ✅ Increased Institutional Participation: ETFs make it easier for large investors to access crypto assets without direct risk of holding the tokens. ✅ Improved Market Legitimacy: SEC approval of an XRP ETF would signal growing confidence in the asset class, potentially influencing global regulators. ✅ Higher XRP Demand: With ETF backing, demand for XRP could surge, potentially impacting its price and liquidity on global exchanges. SEC’s Careful Approach The SEC’s decision to open the review process does not guarantee approval. The agency will scrutinize factors such as market stability, price manipulation risks, custody solutions, and investor protection. Stakeholders, including the public and market participants, will have the opportunity to submit comments during the review period. Ripple’s Legal Battles and Its Impact XRP remains in the spotlight due to Ripple Labs’ ongoing legal entanglement with the SEC regarding whether XRP qualifies as a security. Although recent court rulings have leaned in Ripple’s favor, the final outcome may influence the fate of any XRP ETF application. Market Reaction So Far The XRP market responded positively to the announcement, with prices seeing a minor uptick. Traders and analysts speculate that an approved ETF could drive XRP to new highs, similar to the price booms witnessed when Bitcoin spot ETFs were greenlit earlier this year. Looking Ahead Franklin Templeton’s move is part of a broader trend, as major asset managers seek to diversify their crypto ETF offerings. Should the SEC approve this filing, XRP would become the first major altcoin with a spot ETF in the U.S. — a potential game-changer for altcoin adoption and market maturity."

XRP,"Ripple urges Judge Torres to approve its joint SEC motion, securing reduced penalties, preserving prior rulings, and accelerating long-awaited resolution that could redefine XRP’s regulatory landscape. Ripple and SEC Urge Judge Torres to Acknowledge Settlement and End XRP Case Ripple’s legal team formally petitioned Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York on June 17 to accept a joint motion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating a potential resolution in its prolonged dispute with the regulator over the sale of XRP. The letter, filed by Ripple Labs Inc., conveyed full support for the joint motion and offered further explanation regarding the settlement’s implications. It stressed: Neither the SEC nor Ripple is asking the Court to revise its Summary Judgment Order. The filing underscored that the prior judgment remains binding and persuasive for other courts, regardless of any settlement agreement. The filing clarified that Ripple would not be released from its securities law obligations even if the injunction were dissolved, as it remains subject to the same regulations as all other market participants. The proposed relief in the joint motion includes reduced financial penalties and mitigates appellate risks, representing a compromise that both parties believe will bring the extensive litigation to a close. Ripple asserted that the settlement would resolve outstanding matters over XRP without altering the court’s substantive rulings, thereby conserving judicial resources while still holding Ripple accountable. The company also drew attention to significant regulatory changes underway at the SEC. As stated in the filing: The SEC is reconsidering its regulatory approach to digital assets. A crypto task force has been created to set purpose-fit standards. Ripple supports this, has participated in related meetings, and submitted feedback. Ripple emphasized that its case has been uniquely protracted, involving comprehensive merits and remedies determinations. The company referenced the SEC’s evolving stance: “Given the SEC’s recent commitment to ‘clear rules of the road,’ Ripple urges the Court to acknowledge the settlement to ease burdens across dockets and maintain consistency with prior resolutions.” The company maintained that such an outcome would relieve pressure on both the district and appellate courts while placing Ripple on equal footing with peers who resolved similar matters earlier in the enforcement cycle. The SEC and Ripple filed a joint motion with Judge Torres on June 12, renewing their request to lift an injunction against Ripple and modify the $125 million civil penalty. An earlier joint motion filed in May was denied by Judge Torres due to procedural issues. Concurrently, the two have also asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to pause their ongoing appeals while the district court considers the updated joint proposal."

But there's a flicker of hope: XRP just broke above a descending trendline with resistance near $2.1550, hinting at a potential rebound. Immediate resistance lies around $2.18, and if bulls manage to reclaim $2.20, we could see a push toward the $2.2250 zone — which also aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement from the $2.335 high to the $2.120 low. A clean breakout there? XRP may target $2.2540, then potentially $2.30 or even $2.35 in the next leg up. Still, danger looms below. 🔻 If XRP fails to reclaim $2.20, support at $2.1420 becomes the first line of defense. Breaching $2.120 could trigger a deeper dive — with bears eyeing $2.050 and possibly $2.020 next. 🔍 Tech Signals: MACD: Bearish momentum building RSI: Hovering near 50 — indecision zone 📉 The setup is tense. A bullish breakout could shift momentum sharply — but failure to hold current support might usher in another brutal leg down. Will XRP bounce or bleed? 💬 Share your outlook below. 📊"

XRP,"BOOOOM‼️RIPPLE OFFICIAL ""WE ARE RESTRICTING THE USE OF #XRP TO RETAIL FOR OUR INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS"" THIS COMES DUE TO A MAJOR SUPPLY BURN COMING IN 24 HOURS!! Follow Like Share"
XRP,"SOLID REASONS TO BUY #XRP $XRP NOW!! Here are the most electrifying developments powering the “buy the XRP dip!” narrative right now: --- 🚀 1. Legal Breakthrough on the Horizon Ripple and the SEC recently filed a joint motion to reduce fines and lift the institutional sales ban—suggesting both sides want resolution fast . Court watchers expect a decision within weeks. If Judge Torres rules favorably, XRP resumes institutional flows—potentially sending prices soaring. --- 💰 2. Massive Whale Accumulation On‑chain analytics reveal whale wallets exploded from ~40K active addresses to 295K daily, with over 2,700 wallets holding 1 million+ XRP . The whales are stacking—are you? --- 🏦 3. Institutional Momentum Building A Bitget analyst forecasts XRP could hit $5 by end‑2025, citing rising institutional interest . Meanwhile, Ripple’s tech integrations and global payment partnerships (e.g., XRP Ledger Summit) are accelerating real‑world adoption . --- 📈 4. ETF Speculation & Broader Crypto Tailwinds A potential spot XRP ETF decision expected mid‑June could spark institutional inflows similar to Bitcoin’s 2024 ETF frenzy . That catalyst, combined with dovish central bank rate talk, sets up crypto for a summer rally. --- Sensational Takeaway: The stars are aligning—regulatory clarity, whale demand, corporate adoption, and ETF hype. XRP’s recent dip (~$2.14) is not a breakdown—it’s a springboard for a run to $5+. Waiting for confirmation? That might mean missing the boat. --- 🌟 Ultimate Bull-Case Summary Legal win + institutional unlock = explosive demand Whales are buying—retail should too $5 by year-end is not fantasy—it’s a calculated projection If you’ve been on the fence, now’s the time: Buy XRP. Hold tight. Get ready for liftoff. ---"
XRP,"🚨 XRP Eyes a Bullish Breakout — Will the Fractal Repeat? 💥 The crypto market is holding its breath… and XRP is at the edge of something big. 📉 Price Check: XRP has dipped to ~$2.15 after a 9% pullback from its recent $2.34 high — just ahead of the Fed’s interest rate decision. ⚖️ Legal Twist: Ripple just submitted a new letter backing its $50M joint settlement with the SEC. 📎 They’re not seeking to rewrite the “Summary Judgment.” 💡 They just want clarity — and a lighter penalty. ➡️ Judge Torres originally ordered $125M (not $2B) ➡️ Ripple wants final confirmation of the agreed $50M fine. 📊 Technical Setup: 📍 Key Support: $2.00 📈 Resistance Zones: $2.19, $2.21, $2.23 (EMA clusters) 🔺 Breakout Trigger: Flip $2.34 = Path to $2.65+ This chart setup looks eerily familiar — some analysts spot a fractal pattern mirroring past XRP breakouts. Is history about to repeat? ⏳ All Eyes on the Fed: If rate policy remains stable, altcoin sentiment could shift bullish — and XRP might ride the wave first. 📣 What’s your play? 🛑 Staying cautious until the Fed talks? 🚀 Or buying the dip before XRP makes its move? 👇 Drop your take in the comments."
XRP,"*⚠️ If you know you're an XRP holder with more than 0.1 XRP, you MUST hear this:* 🚨🚨🚨 200,000,000 #XRP (≈439M) just moved from *Ripple* to an *unknown wallet* 🔥💼 What does this mean? 👇 - This isn't a random move — when *Ripple* shifts that much XRP, it's *intentional* and likely *strategic*. - Since it went to an *unknown wallet*, not an exchange, it’s *not* an immediate sell-off signal. 🛑 - Could be for *custody*, *partnerships*, *OTC deals*, or even internal treasury moves. 📊 Analysis: - *Neutral to slightly bullish* until further movement is tracked. - If that wallet later moves XRP to exchanges, *watch out* for sell pressure. - If it stays idle, it's likely a *long-term positioning move* — which is solid. 🧠 For XRP holders: - This is *not FUD*, but it's worth *monitoring whale and Ripple moves*. - Remember, Ripple still holds large XRP reserves, and how they manage it impacts the market. - *Regulatory clarity* is slowly building — this transfer could also relate to strategic positioning for what's ahead. ⚖️ Stay alert, stay smart. 📈💧"
XRP,"XRP Holders: This Isn’t a Dip. It’s a WARNING SHOT. And it’s exactly what the smart money prayed for. Today, XRP crashed over 5% in a matter of hours. $2.25? Gone. $2.20? Crushed. The crowd is panicking. The charts are bleeding. The headlines are grim. But here’s the twist: THIS is the moment legends are made. FEAR IS EVERYWHERE! but that’s how wealth is transferred. From those reacting emotionally. To those who already had a plan. What the Crowd Missed: RSI is tanking but that’s what it did right before XRP’s last 25% breakout. High volume dumps = whale shakeouts, not retail moves. Whale wallets are quietly accumulating near $2.10 (watch the chain). Pattern emerging: descending wedge plus squeeze setup. Historically? Explosive. The Levels That Matter: ZoneSignal$2.05–$2.10Accumulation pocket$2.22–$2.25 Resistance breakout if flipped$1.95If this breaks, all bets are off If You’re a Trader: This is your decision point. You can either: Join the panic sell, regret, repeat. OR Zoom out. See the setup forming. Position smart. Enter before the bounce. Now Tell Me: Do you think XRP rebounds! Back to $2.50? Or are we heading to $1.90? Comment with your target. Let's debate. Save this post you’ll want to revisit it soon. Share if you believe XRP isn’t done yet. Like if you’re still holding.

BNB,"“Build On BNB” — that’s what BOB stands for! Many beginner traders read the name and already see themselves as millionaires, thinking it’s a project by the Binance exchange. Let me disappoint you — and maybe save you from a crash! The name is simply based on Binance Smart Chain — nothing more. BOB has no official connection to Binance. Everything you’ve read elsewhere was just someone trying to hype it up. Because of this hype, news, and pumped-up posts, BOB soared — but now the story seems to be reaching its final chapter. So, take a closer look at your wallets! There are a lot of speculators in the market. If you don’t believe me — just do your own research: Google it, check the blockchain, look for official sources only. I speak from personal experience and don’t push my opinions on anyone.

BNB,"🔥 Hot Movers: $BNB , $BTC , $ETH , #SOL – Red Days Bring Golden Setups! 🚨 The crypto market is experiencing a slight cooldown, but for smart traders, this is the time to sharpen their entries. #bnb is holding strong at $652.72, with only a minor dip of -0.46%, signaling healthy support and potential for a bounce-back. As Binance’s core token, BNB often leads altcoin sentiment — a small retracement like this could be a solid opportunity for those watching the right levels. Meanwhile, BTC has pulled back to $105,414.11, down -1.60%, giving long-term investors a possible re-entry zone before the next major leg up. ETH and SOL are also showing signs of healthy correction. Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at $2,537.47, down -1.64%, offering dip buyers a chance to position before ETH gears up for the next DeFi or ETF-related narrative. Solana (SOL), now at $148.38 with a sharper drop of -3.31%, could attract fast-moving traders looking to capitalize on volatility — especially if support holds near $145. These short-term declines could turn into high-reward setups for those trading with discipline, smart stop-losses, and a focus on confirmed reversal signals. Don’t let red candles scare you — they often lead to green opportunities."

SOL,"Solana ($SOL ) is preparing to re-enter the crypto market’s radar with a quiet but striking technical setup in recent days. The cryptocurrency is trading within both Fibonacci retracement levels and a falling wedge formation, paving the way for a significant price jump. Technical indicators and formations point to a potential rally to $258 in the medium term. 📉 Selling Wave Slows Down, #solana Clinging to Support May Give Expectations The correction movement seen throughout the market over the past week has also affected Solana. However, SOL is approaching the “golden Fibonacci” retracement zone in the $128–140 range, indicating that buyers may re-emerge at historically strong support points. This region is located between the Fibonacci levels of 0.618 and 0.786 and is known as an area where trend reversals frequently occur. This retracement range, which is considered the ""heart of the trend"" in technical analysis, gives the first strong signals that a new upward wave may begin in Solana. 🔺 Falling Wedge Formation: The Messenger of the Hidden Rise One of the most important elements that draws attention in the Solana chart is the falling wedge formation. This technical structure usually indicates that the selling pressure in a falling market has weakened and that a trend reversal is imminent. Currently, the Solana price is moving close to the lower band of this formation. In case of an upward breakout from the formation, the technical targets are: $204.31 $229.01 $258.45 These levels represent a potential increase of 60% to 100% compared to the current price of approximately $149. Therefore, a breakout of the formation could put Solana into a new bull run in a short time. 📊 What Do Technical Indicators Say? Currently, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is showing an upward recovery signal from the oversold zone. This supports the bullish signal, especially at the intersection of the lower limit of the wedge and the Fibonacci zone. Although the MACD indicator has not yet presented a clear intersection, the contraction in the histogram shows that the momentum is preparing to change direction. The consolidation of the price by holding on to the support line may be preparing the ground for a breakout in the short term. 🌪️ High Volatility, But the Structure is Solid The cryptocurrency market generally still has high volatility. However, Solana's price movements show that it has entered a consolidation process at strong support levels in technical terms. This situation offers a strong opportunity area, especially for medium and long-term investors. Another important point to note for investors is not to increase positions before the confirmation of the breakout and to proceed with stop-loss strategies. 📌 Conclusion: Technical and Psychological Ground Strengthens in Solana Solana has reached a very critical threshold both psychologically and technically. The fact that it is in the golden Fibonacci range and in the falling wedge formation increases the possibility of an upward bounce from this region. If this formation breaks upwards, it will not be surprising for Solana to start a strong rise towards the $204-258 band. Therefore, it is of great importance for investors to pay attention to this technical structure and review their positions in volume-supported breaks."

DOGECOIN,"$DOGE : Whales Selling vs. Retail Buying? 🐋 A major conflict is brewing for Dogecoin around the $0.17 level. 📉 Whales are Selling: Money flow data shows large accounts are exiting, with over $31M in net outflows. 📈 Retail is Buying: In contrast, the margin long-short ratio has spiked, showing retail traders are increasingly bullish and leveraged. Key Levels: Support: Watch $0.164. A break below could target $0.125. Resistance: A push past $0.22 is needed for a bullish recovery, with an eye on $0.35. This is a classic standoff between smart money and retail sentiment. Stay alert. (Disclaimer: Not financial advice. Always DYOR.)"
DOGECOIN,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading meme cryptocurrency, has returned to a pivotal support level at $0.168 raising alarms in the crypto community. A weekly close below this line could pave the way for a 30% correction, according to analyst Ali Charts, while bullish technical patterns hint at a possible 350% breakout if support holds. $0.168: The Line Between Bounce or Breakdown DOGE has already dropped nearly 30% from its mid-May highs, retesting the crucial $0.168 support zone a level that also held firm in April. A decisive breakdown could be catastrophic. As per Ali Charts, if Dogecoin loses this level, it could fall into a price “gap area” with minimal historical buying interest, making swift declines more likely. The crypto market is now in a wait-and-see mode. Weekly closes near this line are being closely scrutinized, as they could determine DOGE’s short-term trajectory. Technical Setup: Cup and Handle Offers Hope On the bullish side, Dogecoin is reportedly forming the handle of a multi-year cup-and-handle pattern, a rare and historically bullish chart structure. The symmetrical triangle's lower boundary coincides with current prices, adding more weight to the $0.168 level. Should DOGE break above the triangle's upper trendline, analysts project a price target near $0.75, based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the cup’s depth. This would represent a massive 350% rally from current levels. Bearish Indicators Mount Despite bullish possibilities, momentum indicators aren’t providing much optimism. The 50-day moving average recently fell below the 200-day, forming a death cross, a classic bearish signal. The MACD line continues to diverge below its signal line, signaling downward momentum. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42 and falling below the neutral 50 level, suggesting selling pressure outweighs buying interest. ETF Ruling Looms Large A major catalyst could arrive on June 15, when U.S. regulators are expected to decide on a spot Dogecoin ETF application. Approval could usher institutional money into DOGE and serve as a much-needed bullish jolt. A delay or rejection, however, might push Dogecoin into deeper declines. Market Sentiment and Forecast According to CoinCodex, Dogecoin has recorded 13 green days out of the last 30, with daily price volatility averaging 10.57%. Their projection places DOGE at $0.20 by July 18, indicating a potential 17% upside from current prices. However, market sentiment remains neutral, and on-chain indicators are not showing clear bullish or bearish divergences.

DOGECOIN,"🐶 DOGE: Dead Meme… or Dormant Monster? Dogecoin is slowing down — but don’t mistake silence for surrender. Top analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, just dropped a chart that has veteran traders uneasy. His message? This chart isn’t barking. It’s growling. 🔍 Look closer: the signs are all there. 📌 January 2018 — DOGE hit $0.02… and crashed. 📌 May 2021 — the legendary $0.70 pump… followed by a brutal fade. 📌 Now — it’s stuck under $0.20, posting lower highs and warning of a dangerous rollover. 💣 The LMACD (monthly momentum indicator) is curling downward — a classic sign before major drawdowns. If history repeats? A close under $0.13 could send DOGE into a liquidity vacuum… all the way to $0.049. Meanwhile, macro headwinds are stiff: ⚠️ Fed rate cuts delayed ⚠️ Crypto liquidity drying up ⚠️ Geopolitical fear (Middle East tensions) growing 💬 So what happens next? This could be the long nap before extinction — or the last breath before a wild, meme-powered moon mission. 🔮 One thing’s for sure: Dogecoin is coiling. And when this dog moves… it doesn’t tiptoe. 📉 If you're holding, this is your signal to watch the chart — not the hype. 📈 If you're sidelined, keep cash ready. This could go either way — fast. 💬 Drop your take below."

ADA,"🚀 Cardano $ADA : Bull Run Coming or More Dip? Key Predictions! Cardano (ADA) is sparking big debates! Despite a 15% price drop this week (now near $0.60🔻), analysts still see potential for major gains – some even targeting $1+! Let’s break down the latest predictions and signals. ✅ Bullish Vibes: Key Support & Patterns - Analyst Marcus Corvinus notes is in a ""descending channel"" but with ""accumulation vibes."" If it holds $0.60, he predicts a surge to $0.85, then $1.17! - Rose Premium Signals spotted a possible ""triple bottom"" (bullish pattern) and a ""falling wedge"" – which often leads to breakouts. If ADA holds support and forms a bullish candle, $1.43 could be next! 📊 Mixed Signals: Hope vs. Caution - RSI is OVERSOLD (30) 📉: This often hints at a short-term bounce! - Negative Exchange Netflow ✅: More investors are moving ADA off exchanges → less selling pressure. Historically, this can precede bull runs! - BUT... Whale Alert! 🐋: Big holders dumped 270 MILLION last week! This sell-off may signal bearish sentiment and could pressure prices if others follow. 💡 The Bottom Line While technical patterns and oversold conditions suggest a rebound could happen, whale sales add uncertainty. Watch the $0.60 support level closely – it could make or break ADA’s next big move!"

In a recent statement, he admitted that ""what's killing Cardano is our stablecoin situation"". The total value of stablecoins issued on Cardano is only $33 million, which significantly limits liquidity in the DeFi space. To address this, Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA into Cardano-native stablecoins, specifically USDM, to boost the DeFi ecosystem and generate non-inflationary revenue for the treasury . Key Points of Hoskinson's Proposal: Stablecoin Conversion: Convert 140 million ADA from the treasury into USDM to fill the liquidity gap in Cardano's DeFi ecosystem. Non-Inflationary Revenue: Generate additional revenue for the treasury while improving its overall financial health. DeFi Growth: Enhance Cardano's competitiveness in the crypto market by strengthening its DeFi ecosystem . Community Reaction: Criticism: Some community members have expressed concerns about the potential market impact of such a large ADA conversion, fearing it could lead to a price drop. Support: Others believe this move could help Cardano's growth and competitiveness in the long run. Hoskinson's proposal aims to address the stablecoin shortage and bolster Cardano's position in the blockchain space, but it has sparked debate within the community ."

SUI,"A few days ago, you were hyped to buy $SUI at $4… even $3.5 — because you believed it could hit a new ATH… $10, maybe even $15. Now? The market dips due to the Iran vs Israel conflict. @Sui drops below $3, trading around $2.7 — and suddenly you’re ignoring it. You think it’s dead. That’s exactly what the market wants. It wants to shake you out. It wants you to panic-sell. It wants you to scream, “It’s over.” But in crypto, only the few make life-changing money — the ones who don’t flinch, the ones who buy in blood. Yes, fell. But did its vision fall? Did builders stop building? Did users abandon it? No. What changed… is you. You were ready to buy at $4 — but now it’s dirt cheap, and you hesitate? This is how the game tests you. Winners don’t wait for green candles. They buy when fear is loudest. Are you ready — or just another emotional trader?"

TONCOIN,"Toncoin ($TON ) #Toncoin represents a unique approach to blockchain adoption, leveraging the established user base and infrastructure of Telegram's messaging platform to drive cryptocurrency integration. With over one billion Telegram users worldwide, TON enjoys unprecedented access to potential blockchain adopters, creating a distribution advantage that most cryptocurrency projects cannot replicate. This strategic positioning has enabled the platform to integrate blockchain functionality directly into everyday digital communication. TON's decentralised finance ecosystem has begun showing signs of meaningful development, with lending protocols and decentralised exchanges establishing operations on the network. Whilst the total value locked remains modest compared to established DeFi platforms, the growth trajectory appears sustainable and is supported by Telegram's user base integration. This organic development pattern suggests that TON's DeFi sector may avoid some speculative excesses that have characterised other blockchain ecosystems. Why did this coin make it to this list? Toncoin's strategic advantage through Telegram integration, combined with emerging DeFi infrastructure and technical chart patterns suggesting upward potential, makes it a compelling addition to the top 10 cryptos to buy for buyers seeking exposure to blockchain-social media convergence."
